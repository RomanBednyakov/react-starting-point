432 Park Avenue is a residential skyscraper in New York City that overlooks Central Park. Originally proposed to be 1,300 feet (396.2 meters) in 2011,[4] the structure topped out at 1,396 ft (425.5 m).[3][5][6] It was developed by CIM Group and features 104 condominium apartments. Construction began in 2012 and was completed on December 23, 2015.[1]  The building required the demolition of the 495-room Drake Hotel. Built in 1926, it was purchased for $440 million in 2006 (equivalent to $540 million in 2016) by developer Harry Macklowe and razed the next year. Its footprint became one of New York's most valuable development sites due to its location,[7] between East 56th and 57th Streets on the west side of Park Avenue.
